# 👩‍💼 Employee and Project Management Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
The **Employee and Project Management Analysis** project focuses on building a **Python-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** system to streamline HR and project data operations. Using **Pandas**, this solution automates data cleaning, transformation, merging, and reporting, providing a **centralized data source** for workforce and cost analysis.

The project eliminates manual reconciliation efforts, ensuring **real-time insights** and **data-driven decision-making** for HR and management teams.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Data Integration:** Combined multiple HR and project datasets into a unified analytical model.  
- **ETL Pipeline Development:** Automated data extraction, transformation, and loading using Pandas workflows.  
- **Imputation & Validation:** Applied **imputation algorithms** and **business-rule logic** to correct missing or inconsistent data.  
- **Automated Updates:** Built automated workflows for **designation updates**, **cost estimation**, and **project allocation checks**.  
- **Business Impact:** Delivered a production-ready analytical system that **enhanced workforce planning accuracy** and **eliminated manual reporting delays**.

## 🧠 Tools & Techniques
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** – Data wrangling, transformation, and cleaning  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – For visual analytics and trend representation  
- **ETL Framework Design** – For scalable, repeatable data processing  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Development, testing, and documentation
